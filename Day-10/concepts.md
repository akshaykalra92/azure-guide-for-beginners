# Azure Key Vault Setup Guide

## Overview
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage for sensitive data such as secrets, encryption keys, and certificates. This guide walks you through setting up Azure Key Vault, managing secrets, and integrating it within your applications.

## Key Features and Components of Azure Key Vault
 Secrets Management: AKV securely stores secrets like passwords, API keys, and database connection strings. These secrets are encrypted and can be accessed programmatically or managed via the Azure portal and CLI.

 Key Management: It enables the creation, storage, and management of cryptographic keys used for data encryption and decryption. This includes symmetric and asymmetric keys, which AKV protects within a hardware security module (HSM) where required.

 Certificate Management: AKV facilitates the storage and management of certificates, supporting SSL/TLS for secure communications. It also allows for automatic renewal of certificates issued by integrated Certificate Authorities (CA).

 Access Control: By integrating with Azure Active Directory (AAD) and supporting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Key Vault ensures that access to secrets, keys, and certificates is limited only to authorized users and applications. Access policies can be customized for each Key Vault, providing granular control over permissions.

 Logging and Monitoring: AKV is integrated with Azure Monitor and provides activity logging capabilities. This ensures that actions such as secret creation, access, or deletion are logged, offering visibility for auditing and compliance purposes.

## How Azure Key Vault Works
Azure Key Vault works by creating a secure vault in a specified region. Within this vault, users can store and manage multiple resources:

Secrets are stored as key-value pairs and can be created or updated by users or applications.
Keys are created using supported algorithms and are managed directly within AKV, ensuring secure encryption.
Certificates are managed as secure entities that support SSL/TLS for encrypted communications.
Access to these resources is secured by AAD and managed through access policies or RBAC, depending on organizational requirements. Resources in the vault are encrypted at rest and transit, meeting compliance standards.

## Use Cases
 Application Secrets Management: Store sensitive app credentials like database passwords or API keys.

 Data Encryption: Generate and store encryption keys for data encryption, meeting regulatory standards like GDPR or HIPAA.

 Certificate Lifecycle Management: Manage SSL/TLS certificates used in web applications, with options for automatic renewal.

 Integration with Azure Services: Azure Key Vault integrates seamlessly with services like Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for secure storage and access to secrets and keys.
 
 Azure Key Vault is essential in securing cloud-native applications by providing a centralized, secure, and scalable solution for managing sensitive data. For more information, visit the Azure Key Vault Documentation.

## Prerequisites
- **Azure Subscription** - Sign up [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't have one.
- **Azure CLI** - [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if not installed.
- **Azure AD Authentication** - Required for access control via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Setup

### Creating a Key Vault

#### Using Azure CLI
```bash
# Set variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group>"
KEY_VAULT_NAME="<your-key-vault-name>"
LOCATION="<your-location>"

# Log in to Azure
az login

# Create resource group (if necessary)
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION

# Create Key Vault
az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
